# Notes App

## Description

The Notes App is a simple application for creating, editing, and managing notes. It provides a user-friendly interface for adding and deleting notes, which are stored in `localStorage` for persistence. This project demonstrates the use of JavaScript to manipulate the DOM, handle events, and manage browser storage.
